title: "Biased Random Walk Completed Function"

Recall that we wanted to match `target`:
```{r}
# make a totally random target distribution, but set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
target <- floor(runif(20, min = 300, max = 1000))
names(target) <- 1:20

# I made them integers...
# have a look at this thing:
target
```

And, now, plot it:
```{r}
barplot(target)
```

A completed function to do a biased random walk that will do that is:
```{r}
#' @param init starting value.  Must be an integer between left and right inclusive
#' @param steps the number of steps to take in the random walk
#' @param target a vector of unnormalized (if desired) probabilities
#' @param left the left boundary of the walk
#' @param right the right boundary of the walk
targeted_rando_walk <-  function(init, steps, target, left = 1, right = 20) {
  
  out <- rep(NA, steps + 1)  # to store the output
  out[1] <- init  # start at the initial state
  
  for (i in 2:steps) { 
    step <- sample(c(-1, 1), 1)  # choose if the step is to the left or right
    proposed <- out[i - 1] + step
    
    if (proposed < left || proposed > right) {
      out[i] <- out[i - 1]
    } else if (target[proposed] >= target[out[i - 1]]) {
      out[i] <- proposed
    } else if (target[proposed] < target[out[i - 1]]) {
      if (runif(1) < target[proposed] / target[out[i - 1]]) {
        out[i] <- proposed
      } else {
        out[i] <- out[i - 1]
      }
    }
  }
  out
}
```

We can try that out, letting it run for a million iterations:
```{r}
twalk <- targeted_rando_walk(
  init = 5,
  steps = 1e6,
  target = target
)
```

Now, plot the result:
```{r}
hist(twalk, breaks = 0:21, freq = FALSE)
```

Holy Macaroni!  That looks right on!
